						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">In this part of the process, the overall audience and goals were determined for the website.</p>
					</header>

					<h2>Audience</h2>
						<p>Gaining a better concept of the audience is key to a successful solution.</p>

						<img src="images/map-1.JPG" width="400" height="250" alt="Sticky Note Map"/>
						<p>To get a better image of what the website’s userbase would look like, I constructed a map of intended primary users, secondary users, fans, and skeptics.</p>

						<img src="images/main-audience.JPG" width="400" height="250" alt="Main Audience"/>
						<p>The main audience was determined to be those typically expected to be using an art ministry’s website: artists, art students, those with an interest in art, and local church leaders/members. In the grand scheme of things, these people would be the ones using the website the most.</p>

						<img src="images/secondary-audience.JPG" width="400" height="250" alt="Secondary Audience"/>
						<p>There is also a secondary audience. Naturally, the families of the artists (or art students) may look on the website to get a better feel for what their family member is interested in. International missionary supporters may also want to visit the site to check up on the missionaries’ ministry and to potentially donate to them. It is a ministry, after all.</p>

						<img src="images/fan-notes.JPG" width="400" height="250" alt="Supporter Notes"/>
						<p>Of course, there will be fans and not-so-much fans of the site. The primary fans would be the ones listed in the main and secondary audiences, mainly the artists (or art seekers) and missionary supporters. The not-so-much fans would be those who simply don’t have an interest in art.</p>
