					<h2>About the Ministry</h2>
					<p> The goal of the Nagoya Arts Network International (NANI) is to open doors for Gospel-centered connections and relationships through art. Things such as art exhibitions and discussions are valuable ways of creating meaningful connections with the community. This ministry is used to build upon other church planting endeavors as well.</p>
						<h3>Art Events</h3>
						<p>A variety of artistic events are held to connect with the community. There are activities such as “exhibitions, artist residencies, and discussion groups.”</p>

					<h2>Current Website</h1>
					<p>There is currently no dedicated website for Nagoya Arts Network International. The only source of official online presence is a page on <i>mtw.org</i> (a large, global missionary organization).</p>

			<h2>Japanese Website Design</h2>
				<p>As a Westerner, designing a website for use in Japan requires a knowledge of what the Japanese like to see in their websites. The website 	<a href="https://designmodo.com/japanese-web-design/">designmodo.com</a> provided a list of “10 Distinctive Features of Japanese-Style Web Design” that will be extremely useful in designing a website for the Japanese culture. Below are some relevant takeaways that could be applied to the NANI site.</p>

				<h3>Technological Innovations</h3>
					<p>Japan loves technological innovations. They’re already on the cutting-edge of technology, and their preference for web design is no different. The site provided links to several mind-boggling websites that truly go above and beyond with their design. Though these innovations are very respectable, it doesn’t seem like they’d be a good fit for the ministry’s website. The average user may not be familiar with how to maneuver a fancy website, so it’s probably best to keep it simple so everyone can use it with ease.</p>

				<h3>Unusual Coloring</h3>
					<p>Sometimes, the best solutions don’t always seem conventional. Some Japanese sites use colors that don’t initially seem to go together to create effective solutions. If done correctly and with good purpose, unusual color combinations can lead to a stronger solution. Will this be the case for the NANI website? Maybe, but maybe not.</p>

				<h3>Vertical Writing</h3>
					<p>In the traditional Japanese writing style, Tategaki, the characters are written vertically. This may be a powerful aspect to include in certain parts of the ministry’s site to really appeal to the Japanese culture, both past and present.</p>

				<h3>Nature</h3>
					<p>Nature is highly valued in Japan, and including it in a website can really draw the user in. This goes hand-in-hand with art, as nature is often a big influence.</p>

			<h2>Other Solutions</h2>
				<p>By conducting research on some other international art ministries, two beneficial examples were found.</p>

				<h3>Heart Sounds International</h3>
					<p>The Heart Sounds International ministry is another ministry that uses art to make connections and share the Gospel with non-western countries. Like the Nagoya Arts Network International, art is used to empower both local believers and missionaries to effectively witness and connect with the communities around them. Heart Sounds International promotes culture-based worship music and art to bring genuine worship back to the Creator. What stood out here is that this ministry seeks to adapt to the culture they’re ministering to instead of focusing primarily on Western forms of worship. This should be no different for the arts in Japan. Including Western art is by no means a bad thing, but the Japanese culture should never be neglected.</p>
					<p>As a website, they provided relevant information about their goals and as to what the ministry is about. They have beneficial links to other sites, such as links to their social media platforms and to their partner ministry (OM Arts). Another interesting aspect of the site is the inclusion of a “What Others Say” page. Here, they have provided quotes from several people who have been encouraged by the ministry. Having a testimony page seems like a very good idea. For those interested in seeing what the ministry is about and how it influences others, it can be beneficial to have the thoughts of those who have already been affected. </p>

				<h3>Artists in Christian Testimony International</h3>
					<p>Artists in Christian Testimony International seeks to achieve the same type of goals as the previous ministry and of Nagoya Arts Network International. They seek to send out and prepare artists to share the Gospel with those around the world.</p>
					<p>As for their website, there’s really not any information it lacks. Everything you could possibly want to know about the organization is on the website. It has links to a variety of resources, a way to donate, and a form to sign up for newsletters. From an informational standpoint, they’ve got everything covered. However, when looking over the website, it can feel a little crowded. Some of the information can be combined into one page instead of having separate pages for very similar bits of info. As for organization, there’s nothing that immediately provides the user with a solid starting point. The layout isn’t very convenient.</p>

				<h3>Takeaway</h3>
					<p>Overall, as a takeaway, my site design needs to provide adequate and relevant information in an organized fashion. It needs to be clear to the user as to what they’re looking at, and it needs to be easy to navigate.</p>

			<h2>Statistics</h2>
				<p>In looking for statistics to further support a solution, <i>statista.com</i> revealed a few points of interest. According to the website, a vast majority of the Japanese internet users access the internet through a smartphone or PC. Based on that statistic, it may be helpful to keep in mind what kind of platform the user will be on. The website needs to be organized in a way that can be easily used on any platform.</p>
